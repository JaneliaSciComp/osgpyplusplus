These requests for actions should then be honored\nby the GUI toolkit of the users application.\n\nTo provide more detail, when a GUIEventHandler (e.g. a TrackballManipulator)\nhandles an incoming event, such as a mouse event, it may wish to make\na request of the GUI. E.g. if a model is thrown, the trackball manipulator\nmay wish to start a timer, and be repeatedly called, to continuously refresh the\ncameras position and orientation. However, it has no way of doing this, as it\nknows nothing of the window system in which its operating. Instead, the\nGUIEventHandler issues its request via a GUIActionAdapter, and the viewer\nin use should honour the request, using the GUI system in play.\n\nThere is more than one way of using the GUIActionAdapter. E.g. it may be inherited\ninto a Viewer class, as is done with osgGLUT::Viewer. Alternatively, a simple\nsubclass of GUIActionAdapter (e.g. osgQt::QtActionAdapter) may be passed to\nthe GUIEventHandler::handle() function; once the function has returned, the viewer\nwill then unpack the results and work out what to do to respond to the\nrequests.\n\nAlso there are several ways to run your app and handle the updating of\nthe window.  osgGLUT::Viewer always has a idle callback registered which does a\nredraw all the time.  osgGLUT::Viewer can safely ignore both requestRedraw() and\nrequestContinousUpdate() as these are happening all the time anyway.\n\nOther apps will probably want to respond to the requestRedraw() and\nrequestContinousUpdate(bool) and again there is more than one way to handle it.\nYou can override requestRedraw() and implement to call your own window\nredraw straight away. Or you can implement so that a flag is set and\nthen you then respond the flag being set in your own leisure.\n" )
